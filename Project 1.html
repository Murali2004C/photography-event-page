        Event photography captures images that record scenes and people at specific moments during an event. It can involve various styles, including candid, traditional, photojournalistic, and artistic. Event photographers can tell stories through a series of photographs, emphasizing emotions and intellect. Capturing spontaneous and natural moments, often without posing. Descriptive captions that provide essential information about an image.
        Focusing on posed group shots and formal portraits, common at events like weddings. Exploring creative perspectives and techniques to capture the event's atmosphere and emotion. Helpful for accessibility and digital ADA compliance, ensuring that the visual information is accessible to everyone, including those who are visually impaired.

<p>Event photography rules often center around capturing the story of an event through various compositions and techniques. Focusing on the "5 W's and How" (Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How) can help guide your event photography. Key elements include using the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing, while also considering the event's narrative and the "mood" you want to convey. </p><hr>
